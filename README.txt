In thia project, we experiment the D-KSVD algorithm using two database
1. Synthetic data, which was randomly generated by ourselves
2. The Extended Yale Face Database B (cropped version) 

Main files:
	"main_sythetic.m" - Train and test on synthetic data. 
	"main_d_ksvd.m" - Train and test on Extended Yale Face Database B
					  ***Before running this file, please make sure to modify the variable “diretory2data” (the first line) to the diretory to the database folder which contains all the Extended Yale Face Database B (cropped version) images (total 2414 images). The filename list is in the "filenamelist.txt"

Other files:
	"ksvds.m" - Runs the K-SVD dictionary training algorithm.
	"Better_Dictionary_Element.m" - Find better dictionary element for updating dictionary.
	"omp.m" - Runs the OMP algorithm.
	"synthetic_d_ksvd.m" - Generates synthetic data and runs D-KSVD training.

Output result file:
	"d_ksvd_training_result.mat" - record the result of D-KSVD training
									1. "new_dict" : learned dictionary
									2. "W" : classifier parameter
									3. "coefficient_matrix"
